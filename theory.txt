To create a new virtual Environment 
py -3 -m venv venv

pip install fastapi[all]
pip freeze :- To see all the dependencies installed in the venv
To activate the new virtual environment
Go to More -> Python -> Choose your environment
or 
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

To run the server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

get is the Method which we use(Different kinds of methods are there such as get,post,delete,etc)
("/") this is the path which describes the root
def root() is the function which have all the necessary statement which is to be executed

Schema Validation is using pydantic basemodel. Create a class with all the necesary thing that post required is needed
If some of the content is optional use Optional[variable type] from typing package

HTTPException :- Used for raising HTTP Exception like 404 error or 201 error or error like that
status= To change the status code of each process

Models contain all our tables
SChemas contain all our data that needs to be validated or the data which the user needs to send.
There are several of libraries that w need to import. So carefully study about all of them.


JWT Concepts
When the user logs in a token named as JWT token is created and saved in the local machine. This token 
used to verify whether the user is logged in or not.

This jwt token is created using a function called create_access_token:

`
SECRET_KEY = "09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30

def create_access_token(data:dict):
    encode=data.copy()
    
    expire=datetime.now()+timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    encode.update({"exp":expire})
    JWT_TOKEN=jwt.encode(encode,SECRET_KEY,algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    
    return JWT_TOKEN
`

This has a secret code,algorithm and expire time. Secret code is used make the jwt token which should be
secured and shouldnot be shared with anyone.

For verification purposes, a verify_jwt code is called which decode JWT token and makes sure whether the user is
logged in or not. This function can return either id or what all values we needed to make the jwt token.
